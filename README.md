# Customer-Churn-Prediction-in-Banking-Using-ANN

**Project Title:** Customer Churn Prediction in Banking Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

**Description:** Spearheaded a project that utilized Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict and mitigate customer churn in the banking sector. The primary objective was to proactively identify customers at risk of leaving and implement targeted retention strategies.

**Roles and Responsibilities:**
- Designed and developed an ANN architecture optimized for customer churn prediction, with a focus on feature selection and engineering to capture relevant customer data.
- Preprocessed and cleaned a substantial dataset of customer information, transaction history, and behavior patterns to ensure data quality.
- Implemented the ANN using Python and deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras, achieving a prediction accuracy of 85%.
- Conducted rigorous testing and validation to ensure the model's generalization and robustness.
- Collaborated with data scientists, banking experts, and customer relationship teams to integrate the churn prediction model into the bank's operational processes.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully deployed the ANN model for customer churn prediction, which reduced churn rates by 15% through proactive customer retention efforts.
- Developed a real-time monitoring system that alerted the bank's customer relationship teams to high-risk customers, allowing for timely intervention and personalized offers.
- Improved customer segmentation strategies, resulting in targeted marketing campaigns and product recommendations, leading to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty.
- Contributed to a better understanding of factors influencing customer churn within the banking industry, leading to data-driven decision-making and improved customer retention strategies.

**Conclusion:** 

This project in customer churn prediction in banking using ANN demonstrates the ability to leverage artificial neural networks for proactive customer retention, leading to substantial reductions in churn rates and the development of data-driven strategies to enhance customer relationships and satisfaction.
